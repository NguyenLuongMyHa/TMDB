# Features

1. **Movies list screen (Trending and Search):**
- Add a search field to the top of the screen.
- If the search field is empty, please use this endpoint: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/trending-movies to get the trending movies for today and create an infinite list (query the next page as it scrolls).
- Trending movies should work offline after loading once. Please ensure the queries are cached and use cached ones if needed again. (if the timestamp is still valid).
- When the search field text is not empty, please use this endpoint to search for movies: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/search-movie (this should only work online, no caching needed).
- The list header should be either: Trending movies or Search results.
- The List Item (for both trending and search results) should include an image (poster or backdrop), movie title, year and vote average. Please use Material3 design standards for simplicity.
- Users can get more movie details when clicking on the list item.
